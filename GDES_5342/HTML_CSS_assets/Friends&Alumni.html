                    <p>We invite our friends and alumni to stay in touch with us and support our students and programs. Through their study of history, our students learn the essential skills of citizen`ship and a better understanding of what it means to be human.</p>
                    <p>Your support is critical to our students’ success. Your gift to the History Department supports scholarships and programs that will help them excel as students and reach their full potential as graduates of the University of Utah.</p>
                    <h2>OF INTEREST...</h2>
                    <p>This year the History Department is pleased to announce the creation of the James L. Clayton Distinguished Research Chair in the Department of History. This is an innovative award created to honor our recently retired colleague, Jim Clayton, and offer vital support to especially promising research projects in the department.</p>

                    <p>Thanks to the generosity of several large donors, including the George S. and Dolores Doré Eccles Foundation, along with the support of scores of former students, colleagues, and friends, the Dean L. May Graduate Fellowship in the History of Utah and the American West has become a reality.</p>
